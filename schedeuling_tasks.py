# 	"""
#     Generates an optimized schedule of tasks and breaks within a given timeframe, taking into account the user's peak cognitive hours, current stress level, and task attributes.
#
#     The function sorts tasks by importance, urgency, and flexibility. It schedules tasks during the user's peak cognitive hours if the task's required energy level is within the user's current capacity. It also incorporates breaks following scientific productivity techniques, such as the Pomodoro technique and ultradian rhythm alignment.
#
#     Parameters:
#     - tasks (List[Task]): A list of Task namedtuples, where each Task contains information about the task name, due date, estimated duration, whether it's a habit, frequency of the habit, importance, category, flexibility, energy required, dependency, interruption level, and enjoyment level.
#     - start_time (datetime.datetime): The start time from which the scheduling should begin.
#     - end_time (datetime.datetime): The end time by which all tasks should be scheduled.
#     - user_peak_hours (List[int]): A list of integers representing the hours of the day during which the user is most productive.
#     - current_stress_level (int): The user's self-assessed current stress level on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the least stressed and 5 being the most.
#
#     Returns:
#     - List[tuple]: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a datetime object representing the start time of the task or break, and the task itself or a string 'Break' indicating a break period.
#
#     The function assumes that the user has a consistent set of peak hours. It does not account for the variability of peak hours throughout the week or changes in stress levels over time. The function also assumes that the user can accurately predict the duration of each task and their stress levels.
