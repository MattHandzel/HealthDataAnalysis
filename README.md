# Health Data Analysis
In this project I will analyze a lot of data about myself and use that to track my progress (like how my cut is going) and to figure out how I can improve my health and my life.

## Equipment
This is a project that will analyze data from a variety of sources, from my smartwatch (for health-related metrics like sleep, steps walked, hr, etc.) from my phone (used for my location log and to log my weight-training sessions), from my google calendar (to get an idea of how I spend my time), and computer (to understand when and how frequently I use my computer)

## Data/Insights
